The **Keyframes** styles provides a collection of reusable animations created using CSS keyframes for easily incorporating eye-catching animations without the need for complex JavaScript or third-party libraries.

# Enable Keyframes

When generating you own customized version of LowCSS, you can enable **Keyframes** by including the `low.keyframes()` mixin in your SCSS stylesheet:

```scss
@use "low" with (
    // ...custom configuration
);

@include low.keyframes();
// ...other lowcss modules
```

# Animations

## Bounce

The **bounce** animation creates a bouncing effect, giving an element a playful and dynamic appearance. Use the `animation-bounce` utility for applying a bounce animation to the element.

<ExampleCode className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center">
    <div className="animation-bounce w-8 h-8 bg-blue-400 rounded-full" />
    <div className="h-1 bg-gray-200 w-12" />
</ExampleCode>

```html
<div class="animation-bounce [...]"></div>
``` 

## Fade In

The `fadein` animation gradually fades an element in, smoothly transitioning it from transparent to fully visible.

```html
<div class="animated fadein">Fading In Element</div>
```

## Fade Out

The `fadeout` animation gradually fades an element out, smoothly transitioning it from fully visible to transparent.

```html
<div class="animated fadeout">Fading Out Element</div>
```

## Ping

The `ping` animation creates a pulsating effect, making an element quickly fade in and out to draw attention.

```html
<div class="animated ping">Pinging Element</div>
```

## Pulse

The `pulse` animation creates a subtle pulsating effect, giving an element a gentle breathing-like animation.

```html
<div class="animated pulse">Pulsating Element</div>
```

## Spin

The `spin` animation rotates an element continuously, creating a spinning effect.

```html
<div class="animated spin">Spinning Element</div>
```
