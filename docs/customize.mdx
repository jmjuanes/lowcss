LowCSS provides extensive customization options, allowing you to tailor the CSS utilities to match your project's specific needs and design requirements.

# Modifying SASS Variables

To customize the CSS utilities, you can modify the following SASS variables in your project:

## $prefix

The `$prefix` variable allows you to specify a custom prefix for all utility classes. By default, the prefix is set to an empty string. However, you can change it to match your project's naming conventions or to avoid conflicts with other CSS frameworks.

Example usage:

```scss
@use "low" with (
    $prefix: "my-prefix-",
);
```

With this customization, utility classes will be prefixed with `my-prefix-`, such as `my-prefix-text-red-500` or `my-prefix-bg-blue-100`.

## $separator

The `$separator` variable defines the character used to separate breakpoints and modifiers from utility names. By default, the separator is set to `:`. However, you can change it to another character if desired.

Example usage:

```scss
@use "low" with (
    $separator: "_",
);
```

With this customization, utility classes will use an underscore (`_`) as the separator, such as `hover_text-red-500` or `focus_bg-blue-100`.

## $breakpoints

LowCSS includes a set of predefined breakpoints for responsive utilities. You can customize these breakpoints using the `$breakpoints` SASS map.

Example:

```scss
@use "low" with (
    $breakpoints: (
        "sm": 640px,
        "md": 768px,
        "lg": 1024px,
        "xl": 1280px,
    ),
);
```

Adjust the values within the map to match your desired screen size breakpoints.

## $theme

The `$theme` variable is a SASS map that contains the configuration for your theme, and allows you to define colors, spacing, fonts, and other theme-related settings. Modify the values in this map to match your project's design system.

Example usage:

```scss
@use "low" with (
    $theme: (
        "text-color": (
            "primary": #ff0000,
            "secondary": #00ff00,
        ),
        "width": (
            "small": 8px,
            "medium": 16px,
        ),
    ),
    // Add more configurations...
);
```

With this customization, you can use the defined theme colors and spacing values in your utility classes.

This is the list of allowed fields in the `$theme` variable for customizing utilities values:

<table className="w-full leading-normal">
    <thead>
        <tr className="border border-gray-300">
            <td className="p-4 font-bold bg-gray-100">Variable</td>
            <td className="p-4 font-bold bg-gray-100">Description</td>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        {Array.from(new Set(Object.values(props.utilities).map(u => u.theme).flat())).map(key => (
        <tr key={key} className="border border-gray-300 text-xs">
            <td className="p-4 font-mono text-blue-600">
                <span>{key}</span>
            </td>
            <td className="p-4 text-gray-700">
                <span>Values for </span>
                <span>
                    {Object.keys(props.utilities).filter(u => props.utilities[u].theme.includes(key)).map(u => (
                        <Fragment key={u}>
                            <span className="font-mono font-bold text-gray-900">{u}</span>
                            <span className="last:hidden">, </span>
                        </Fragment>
                    ))}
                </span> utilities.
            </td>
        </tr>
        ))}
    </tbody>
</table>


## $variants

The `$variants` variable is a SASS map that allows you to customize the variants for utilities, such as responsive and pseudo-class modifiers. 

Example usage:

```scss
@use "low" with (
    $variants: (
        "background-color": ("default", "responsive", "hover", "focus", "active"),
        // Add more variants customizations...
    ),
);
```

This is the default variants configuration:

<CodeBlock language="scss">
{`$variants: (
${Object.keys(props.utilities).map(key => `    ${key}: (${props.utilities[key].variants.map(v => `'${v}'`).join(", ")}),`).join("\n")}
);`}
</CodeBlock>

## $include and $exclude

The `$include` and `$exclude` variables are lists that allow you to selectively include or exclude specific utility classes in the final CSS output. By default, all utilities are included. Use these variables to fine-tune the set of utilities you want to include in your project.

Example usage:

```scss
@use "low" with (
    $exclude: (
        "background-color",
        "text-color",
    ),
);
```

With this customization, the background color and text color utilities will be excluded from the final CSS output.

# Inject LowCSS styles

Use the following mixins to include the LowCSS styles into your CSS:

- `low.base()`: this mixin injects the base styles. Read more in the [Base Styles](./base.html) section.
- `low.utilities()`: this mixin injects the utility classes.

Example usage:

```scss
// 1. Import and configure lowcss
@use "low" with (
    // ...custom configuration
);

// 2. Inject lowcss styles
@include low.base();
@include low.utilities();
```

# Compiling SASS and Generating CSS

To compile the SASS files and generate the CSS output, follow these steps:

**1. Install SASS**. If you haven't already, install the SASS compiler on your system by following the instructions provided in the official SASS documentation.

**2. Compile SASS**. Use the SASS compiler to compile your customized SASS files into CSS. Here's an example command:

```bash
$ sass --load-path=./node_modules/lowcss input.scss output.css
```

**3. Link the CSS**. In your HTML file, link the generated CSS file using a `<link>` tag in the `<head>` section:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/output.css">
```

Replace `path/to/output.css` with the actual path to your generated CSS file.
