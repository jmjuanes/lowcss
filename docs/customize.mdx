LowCSS provides extensive customization options, allowing you to tailor the CSS utilities to match your project's specific needs and design requirements.

# Customize utilities

To customize the CSS utilities, you can import LowCSS into your project and modify the SASS variables that it exports to generate custom utilities matching you specific needs:

```scss
@use "low" with (
    $prefix: "lw-",
    $breakpoints: (
        "sm": 640px,
        "md": 768px,
        "lg": 1024px,
        "xl": 1280px,
    ),
    $theme: (
        "background-color": (
            "primary": #0456C9,
            "secondary": #a4abb6,
        ),
    ),
);
``` 

Read more in the [SASS variables configuration](./variables) section.

# Inject LowCSS styles

Use the following mixins to include the LowCSS styles into your CSS:

- `low.base()`: this mixin injects the base styles. Read more in the [Base Styles](./base.html) section.
- `low.utilities()`: this mixin injects the utility classes.

Example usage:

```scss
// 1. Import and configure lowcss
@use "low" with (
    // ...custom configuration
);

// 2. Inject lowcss styles
@include low.base();
@include low.utilities();
```

# Compiling SASS and Generating CSS

To compile the SASS files and generate the CSS output, follow these steps:

**1. Install SASS**. If you haven't already, install the SASS compiler on your system by following the instructions provided in the official SASS documentation.

**2. Compile SASS**. Use the SASS compiler to compile your customized SASS files into CSS. Here's an example command:

```bash
$ sass --load-path=./node_modules/lowcss input.scss output.css
```

**3. Link the CSS**. In your HTML file, link the generated CSS file using a `<link>` tag in the `<head>` section:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/output.css">
```

Replace `path/to/output.css` with the actual path to your generated CSS file.
