Here are the colors available in the default palette:




# Using the color palette with SASS

You can harness the power of the default color palette within your SASS styles by utilizing the predefined color variables. This approach allows you to maintain consistency across your styles while leveraging the flexibility of SASS.

First import the color palette as a module in you SASS file:

```scss
@use "low/colors" as colors;
```

Use the `get-color` to get a color from the color palette:

```scss
.btn {
    background-color: colors.get-color("blue-500");
}
```

You can use this function to customize utilities:

```scss
@use "low/colors" as colors;
@use "low" with (
    $theme: (
        "colors": (
            "primary": colors.get-color("blue-500"),
            "secondary": colors.get-color("gray-500"),
            "success": colors.get-color("green-500"),
            "warning": colors.get-color("yellow-600"),
            "error": colors.get-color("red-500"),
        ),
    ),
);
```
