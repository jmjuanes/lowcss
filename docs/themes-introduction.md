# Themeable Utilities

Themeable utilities bring the power of **CSS variables** to your utility-based styling, making it easier than ever to customize UI components dynamically. Instead of using fixed color values, these utilities leverage CSS variables, allowing you to **define themes, switch styles effortlessly, and create a consistent design system**.

With themeable utilities, you can:

- **Apply Theme-Based Styling**: use utilities like `bg-primary`, `text-secondary`, and `border-accent` to theme your UI components.  
- **Easily Customize with CSS Variables**: modify your theme dynamically by updating the corresponding CSS variables.  
- **Support States, Pseudo-Elements, and Responsive Design**: just like any other utility, themeable utilities work with hover states, pseudo-elements, and responsive prefixes.  
- **Use as a Standalone Feature**: if you only need themeable utilities (without the full framework), you can include them separately via `low.themes.css`.
