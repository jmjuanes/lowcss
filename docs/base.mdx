# Reset

**Reset CSS** is collection of styles that aims to provide a consistent and cross-browser baseline for styling HTML elements. It helps normalize the default styles applied by different browsers, ensuring a more consistent and predictable rendering of web pages across various devices and browsers.

By enabling **Reset CSS**, you can start with a clean slate, eliminating inconsistencies in default styles and reducing the need for excessive CSS overrides.

For a complete list of changes and styles, please refer to the [source stylesheet](https://github.com/jmjuanes/lowcss/blob/main/low/_reset.scss).

## Box-sizing

It changes the `box-sizing` property of all elements to `border-box`. This ensures that the width and height of elements are calculated including padding and border, providing a more intuitive box model.

```css
*,
*:before,
*:after {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

## Borders are removed in all elements

It resets the `border-width` to `0` and initializes the `border-syle` to `solid` in all elements.

```css
*,
*:before,
*:after {
    border-color: currentColor;
    border-style: solid;
    border-width: 0;
}
```

## Margins

It resets the default margin of some elements (including headings and paragraphs) to `0`. This eliminates any inconsistencies in default spacing applied by different browsers.

```css
blockquote,
h1,
h2,
h3,
h4,
h5,
h6,
hr,
p,
pre {
    margin: 0;
}
```

## Headings

It normalizes the font-related properties such as `font-family` and `font-weight` in heading elements to provide a consistent typography baseline.

```css
h1,
h2,
h3,
h4,
h5,
h6 {
    font-size: inherit;
    font-weight: inherit;
}
```

## Links

Sets the default styles for anchor links elements to remove underline and inherit color:

```css
a {
    color: inherit;
    text-decoration: inherit;
}
```

## Lists

It removes the default styles for unordered and ordered lists (`ul` and `ol`) to eliminate any browser-specific list styles.

```css
ul,
ol,
dl {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
}
```

## Tables

It resets the default border styles for tables.

```css
table {
    border-collapse: collapse;
    border-spacing: 0;
}
```

## Form elements

It resets the default typography, padding, and margin properties common form elements:

```css
button,
input,
select,
textarea {
    color: inherit;
    font-family: inherit;
    font-weight: inherit;
    line-height: inherit;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
}
```

It also prevents resizing textareas horizontally by default:

```css
textarea {
    resize: vertical;
}
```

# Keyframes

We provide a collection of keyframes animation styles that can be used in conjunction with the animation utilities to create engaging and dynamic animations in your web projects. These predefined keyframes styles provide a quick and convenient way to add commonly used animations without the need to write complex CSS animations from scratch.

## Bounce

The **bounce** animation creates a bouncing effect, giving an element a playful and dynamic appearance. Use the `animation-bounce` utility for applying a bounce animation to the element.

```css
@keyframes bounce {
    0%,
    100% {
        transform: translateY(-25%);
        animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.8, 0, 1, 1);
    }
    50% {
        transform: translateY(0);
        animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.2, 1);
    }
}
``` 

## Fade In

The `fadein` animation gradually fades an element in, smoothly transitioning it from transparent to fully visible. Use the `animation-fadein` utility for applying a fade in animation to the element.

```css
@keyframes fadein {
    from {
        opacity: 0;
    }
    to {
        opacity: 1;
    }
}
```

## Fade Out

The `fadeout` animation gradually fades an element out, smoothly transitioning it from fully visible to transparent. Use the `animation-fadeout` utility for applying a fade out animation to the element.

```css
@keyframes fadeout {
    from {
        opacity: 1;
    }
    to {
        opacity: 0;
    }
}
```

## Ping

The `ping` animation creates a pulsating effect, making an element quickly fade in and out to draw attention. Use the `animation-ping` utility for applying a ping animation to the element.

```css
@keyframes ping {
    75%,
    100% {
        transform: scale(2);
        opacity: 0;
    }
}
```

## Pulse

The `pulse` animation creates a subtle pulsating effect, giving an element a gentle breathing-like animation. Use the `animation-pulse` utility for applying a pulse animation to the element.

```css
@keyframes pulse {
    0%,
    100% {
        opacity: 1;
    }
    50% {
        opacity: 0.5;
    }
}
```

## Spin

The `spin` animation rotates an element continuously, creating a spinning effect. Use the `animation-spin` utility for applying a spin animation to the element.

```css
@keyframes spin {
    from {
        transform: rotate(0deg);
    }
    to {
        transform: rotate(360deg);
    }
}
```

# Enable or disable base styles

When generating you own customized version of LowCSS, you can enable or disable all base styles by including the `low.base()` mixin in your SCSS stylesheet:

```scss
@use "low" with (
    // ...custom configuration
);

@include low.base();
```

Individual base styles can be included or excluded using the `$include` or `$exclude` variables:

```scss
@use "low" with (
    $include: (
        "reset",
        "keyframes",
        // ...
    ),
    // ...other custom configuration
);

// This will include only reset and keyframes styles
@include low.base();
```
