# Package Installation

To get started with LowCSS, you can install the package using either **Yarn** or **npm**. Follow the instructions below based on your preferred package manager:

Installation with **Yarn**:

```bash
$ yarn add lowcss
``` 

Installation usin **npm**:

```bash
$ npm install lowcss
```

# Including Precompiled CSS

LowCSS provides precompiled CSS files located in the `dist` folder of the package. To include the precompiled CSS in your project, follow these steps:

**1.** Locate the `dist` folder within the LowCSS package in your project's `node_modules` directory.

**2.** Copy the precompiled CSS file `low.css` from the `dist` folder to your project's assets or CSS directory.

**3.** Link the CSS file in your HTML file using a `<link>` tag in the `<head>` section:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/low.css">
```

# Generating Custom Version with SASS

To generate a custom version of LowCSS using SASS, follow these steps:

**1.** If you haven't already, install the SASS compiler on your system by following the instructions provided in the official [SASS documentation](https://sass-lang.com).

**2.** Add a new SASS file with `.scss` extension (e.g., `main.scss`) in your project.

**3.** Import LowCSS in your SASS file and customize the imported SASS variables and utility classes to match your project's needs. Refer to the [Customization section](./customize.html) for more details on available variables and customization options.

```scss
@use "low" with (
    // custom configuration
);
``` 

<div className="px-6 py-1 rounded-md bg-blue-100 mb-6">
Read more about how to override variables with the `@use` rule in the [Sass documentation](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use#configuration).
</div>

**4.** Load the modules of LowCSS that you need using the `@include` directive:

```scss
@include low.base();
@include low.utilities();
```

**5.** Compile SASS file into CSS using the SASS compiler. Run the following command:

```bash
$ sass --load-path=./node_modules/lowcss main.scss output.css
```

Replace `main.scss` with the path to your custom SASS file, and `output.css` with the desired path and filename for the generated CSS file.

**6.** Link the generated CSS file in your HTML file using a `<link>` tag in the `<head>` section, as described in the "Including Precompiled CSS" section.

# Using Hosted Version from CDN

If you prefer not to install or compile [Framework Name] locally, you can utilize the hosted version from a Content Delivery Network (CDN). Simply include the following `<link>` tag in the `<head>` section of your HTML file:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/lowcss/dist/low.css">
```

**Note**: Using the hosted version means you won't have direct control over customizations. Consider the custom version generation with SASS for more flexibility.
