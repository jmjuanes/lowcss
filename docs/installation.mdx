# Install using a Package Manager

## 1. Add LowCSS to your project

Use **YARN** or **NPM** for adding LowCSS as a dependency to your project. Just run the following command in the root folder of your project:

```bash
$ yarn add lowcss
```

## 2. Import LowCSS in your main Sass file

Include the following line to your main `.scss` file:

```scss
@use "low";
``` 

Optionally, you can also customize LowCSS loading it with customization. See the [configuration](configuration.html) guide for more information.

```scss
@use "low" with (
    $prefix: "ui-",
    $colors: (
        primary: blue,
        secondary: green,
    ),
);
``` 

<div className="px:6 py:1 r:md bg:blue-100 mb:6">
Read more about how to override variables with the `@use` rule in the [Sass documentation](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use#configuration).
</div>

## 3. Load the modules of LowCSS that you need

Use the `@include` directive to load the modules of LowCSS:

```scss
@include low.reset();
@include low.forms();
@include low.keyframes();
@include low.scrollbars();
@include low.utilities();
```

## 4. Compile your styles

Use the Sass CLI to generate the output Css:

```bash
$ sass --load-path=./node_modules/lowcss main.scss dist/low.css
``` 

Read more about the Sass CLI usage and available flags in the [Sass CLI documentation](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/cli).

# Install using a CDN

This is the easiest way for adding LowCSS to your project. Just include the following line in the head of your `.html` file:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/lowcss@0.9.0/dist/low.css">
```

Note that this method does not allow customization of the CSS utilities.
