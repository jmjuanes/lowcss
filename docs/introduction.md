# Introduction

**LowCSS** is a powerful **Utility CSS framework** built with SASS, designed to streamline your CSS development process and enable you to create beautiful, responsive web interfaces with ease. Inspired by the popular [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), LowCSS follows a similar structure and syntax, making it familiar and intuitive for developers already familiar with Tailwind CSS.

##  Intuitive Utility Classes

Use utility classes to apply styles directly to HTML elements, avoiding repetitive CSS coding. Prototype and iterate at lightning speed using a wide range of pre-designed utility classes that cover virtually every styling need.

```html
<button class="px-3 py-2 bg-gray-800 text-white">
    Click me!
</button>
```

## Responsiveness made easy

Craft responsive layouts effortlessly using responsive utility classes that adapt styles based on breakpoints.

```html
<div class="w-full text-center md:text-left">
    Centerd text in mobile devices.<br>
    Left aligned in desktop an tablet.
</div>
```

## Pseudo-Class modifiers

Apply styles to elements in specific states like hover, focus, and active.

```html
<button class="bg-gray-800 hover:bg-gray-900 focus:outline-blue-200 text-white px-3 py-2">
    Hover me!
</button>
```
