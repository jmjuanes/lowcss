You can customize LowCSS by importing it in your SASS file and customize the imported SASS variables and utility classes to match your project's needs. 

```scss
@use "low" with (
    $prefix: "lw-",
    $breakpoints: (
        "sm": 640px,
        "md": 768px,
        "lg": 1024px,
        "xl": 1280px,
    ),
    $utilities: (
        "background-color": (
            "classname": "background",
            "variants": ("default"),
            "values": (
                "primary": #0456C9,
                "secondary": #a4abb6,
            ),
        ),
    ),
    $include-utilities: (
        "background-color",
    ),
);
``` 

This configuration will generate the following CSS:

```css
.background-primary {
    background-color: #0456C9;
}
.background-secondary {
    background-color: #a4abb6;
}
```

Read more about how to override variables with the `@use` rule in the [Sass documentation](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use#configuration).

# Configuration variables

## $prefix

The `$prefix` variable allows you to specify a custom prefix for all utility classes. By default, the prefix is set to an empty string. However, you can change it to match your project's naming conventions or to avoid conflicts with other CSS frameworks.

Example usage:

```scss
@use "low" with (
    $prefix: "my-prefix-",
);
```

With this customization, utility classes will be prefixed with `my-prefix-`, such as `my-prefix-text-red-500` or `my-prefix-bg-blue-100`.

## $separator

The `$separator` variable defines the character used to separate breakpoints and modifiers from utility names. By default, the separator is set to `:`. However, you can change it to another character if desired.

Example usage:

```scss
@use "low" with (
    $separator: "_",
);
```

With this customization, utility classes will use an underscore (`_`) as the separator, such as `hover_text-red-500` or `focus_bg-blue-100`.

## $breakpoints

LowCSS includes a set of predefined breakpoints for responsive utilities. You can customize these breakpoints using the `$breakpoints` SASS map.

Example:

```scss
@use "low" with (
    $breakpoints: (
        "sm": 640px,
        "md": 768px,
        "lg": 1024px,
        "xl": 1280px,
    ),
);
```

Adjust the values within the map to match your desired screen size breakpoints.

## $colors

Use this map to provide your custom color palette for all utilities.

```scss
@use "low" with (
    $colors: (
        "black": #000,
        "white": #fff,
        "primary": #0456C9,
        "secondary": #a4abb6,
    ),
);
```

## $utilities

The `$theme` variable is a SASS map that contains the custom configuration for your utilities. The key of this map is the utility name, and the value should be a map with your custom configuration. The following keys are available:

- `classname`: a string with the classname of the utility.
- `variants`: a list with the variants for the utility, such as responsive and pseudo-class modifiers.
- `values`: a map with your custom values.

Example usage:

```scss
@use "low" with (
    $utilities: (
        "text-color": (
            "variants": ("default", "responsive", "hover", "focus", "active"),
            "values": (
                "primary": #ff0000,
                "secondary": #00ff00,
            ),
        ),
    ),
    // Add more configurations...
);
```

## $include-utilities and $exclude-utilities

The `$include-utilities` and `$exclude-utilities` variables are lists that allow you to selectively include or exclude specific utility classes in the final CSS output. By default, all utilities are included. Use these variables to fine-tune the set of utilities you want to include in your project.

Example usage:

```scss
@use "low" with (
    $exclude-utilities: (
        "background-color",
        "text-color",
    ),
);
```

With this customization, the background color and text color utilities will be excluded from the final CSS output.
