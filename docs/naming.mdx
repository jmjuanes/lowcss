Our utility class name design consists of the following components:

```
[{prefix}]{class}:{modifier}[:{state_variant}][@{responsive_variant}]
``` 

- `prefix` (optional): you can configure LowCSS to add a prefix to all utility classes to avoid class name collisions.
- `class`: is the utility class name (e.g. `text` for text utilities, `bg` for background utilities, and so on).
- `modifier`: allow you to specify the utility value such as text sizes, colors, spacing, effects, filters, and more.
- `state_variant`: you can use the state variants to conditionally apply the utility class when the target variant is triggered (e.g. `:hover` when the user hovers the element, `:focus` when the element is focussed, and so on).
- `responsive_variant`: to conditionally apply the utility class with different breakpoints.

<ExampleCode className="">
    <div className="text:teal-500:hover text:center">This text will change color when hovered!</div>
</ExampleCode>

```html
<div class="text:teal-500:hover text:center">
    This text will change color when hovered!
</div>
```
